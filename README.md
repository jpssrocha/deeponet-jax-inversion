# Inversion procedures using DeepONets as surrogates

In this repository i'll be conducting some experiments using Deep Operator
Networks (deeponets) as differentiable surrogate models for inversion
procedures leveraging the Jax library and Equinox framework for doing so.


NOTE: I'm not checking in this repository the large files generated in each
step to avoid having to use git LFS at the beggining. Nonetheless all the data
can be regenerated using the notebooks.
