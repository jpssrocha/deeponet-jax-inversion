# Inversion procedures using DeepONets as surrogates

In this repository i'll be conducting some experiments using Deep Operator
Networks (deeponets) as differentiable surrogate models for inversion
procedures leveraging the Jax library and Equinox framework for doing so.

**ENMC 2025**: All the work related to the work submitted to the ENMC with the
preliminary results on a low dimensional problem - the Damped Pendulum problem -
is stored at the `notebook/mass-spring` folder.

# File structure:

.
├── modules
├── notebook
├── outputs
├── pyproject.toml
├── raw_data
├── training_cache
└── uv.lock

- **modules**: Scripts with common code or performance sensible experiments.
- **notebook**: Detailed notebooks for all the experiments.
- **outputs**: Folder expected by the notebooks and scripts to dump outputs.
- **pyproject.toml** and **uv.lock**: Files generated by uv to assure environment reproducibility.
- **training_cache**: Folder expected by code that can recover training progress.

**NOTE**: I'm not checking in this repository the large files generated in each
step to avoid having to use git LFS at the beggining. Nonetheless all the data
can be regenerated using the notebooks with the exception of the permeability
ones since the field data was supplyed to me by a collaborator.
